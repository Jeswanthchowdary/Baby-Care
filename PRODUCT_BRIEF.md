## 1. 🎯 Problem Framing & Prompt Selection

**Prompt Chosen:** "X for Y (Audience-first)"

**Your X for Y:** The product is an **Ingredient Safety Scanner (X)** for **New Parents (Y)**.

**Problem Statement:** New parents are often overwhelmed and anxious about the safety of the products they use for their babies. They lack a simple, trustworthy tool to quickly decipher complex ingredient lists on products like lotions, diapers, and food, leading to uncertainty and time-consuming research. Baby Care provides immediate peace of mind by offering a simple scan-and-check solution tailored to their baby's specific needs.

## 2. 🗺️ User Journey & Core UX

**User Story:** As a new parent, I want to quickly scan a baby product's barcode **or search for it by name** and see a simple, personalized safety report, so I can confidently decide if it's safe for my baby.

**Screenshots/Flowchart:** The core user experience is designed to be simple and intuitive, guiding the user from initial setup to a clear result in just a few taps.

1.  **Onboarding:** The user first sets up a profile for their baby, specifying any known allergies, skin sensitivities, or dietary goals. This ensures all future reports are personalized.
2.  **Home Screen:** The user is presented with two clear options: scan a product barcode for in-store shopping, or manually search by product name for e-commerce research.
3.  **Scanning/Searching (Implied):** The user scans a product barcode or types in a product name.
4.  **Report Card:** The user immediately sees a detailed "Report Card" for the product. This screen provides a clear "SAFE" or "WARNING" status based on their profile, a safety grade, and a breakdown of all ingredients.
5.  **Action & Comparison:** From the report, the user can save a product to their "Safe List" or "Avoid List" for future reference. If the product is not suitable or the user is curious, they can also instantly compare it to safer alternatives in a simple, side-by-side view, empowering them to make the best choice.

## 3. 📈 Growth & Measurement Strategy

**Monetisation Idea:** The application will operate on a **Freemium model**. The core scanning and safety report features will be free to all users. Monetization will be driven by **affiliate links** from the "Safe Alternatives" feature. When a user clicks on a recommended product and makes a purchase, the application will earn a commission. This aligns with the app's goal of helping parents find safe products without creating a barrier to entry.

**Retention Idea:** Retention is built around making the app a **habit** for parents during their shopping routine, both in-store and online. The key retention loop is: **Scan/Search → Get Report → Compare → Save to List**. By allowing users to create and manage "My Lists" of approved (or rejected) products, the app becomes a personalized shopping companion. As the user builds their lists, the app becomes more valuable and harder to replace, encouraging repeated use.

**One Metric You'd Track:** The North Star Metric would be the **Percentage of Monthly Active Users who receive a "SAFE" report for a scanned or searched product**. This metric is critical because it directly measures the core value proposition of the app: providing parents with the peace of mind that they are choosing safe products for their baby. A high percentage indicates that the app is successfully guiding users towards suitable products, which in turn will lead to higher user satisfaction, retention, and trust.
